                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently 21 years old and am working as a coach at Sailfish Swim Team in Round Rock, Texas. This is my fourth year coaching and it has been nothing short of incredible, both in terms of the people I have been able to work with and the things I have  been able to learn along the way. When I am not on deck you can usually find me working with electronics or trying to figure out how to bring my next project to life.
